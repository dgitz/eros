# Data Logger

## Overview
No more running ```rosbag record --all``` from the command line again!

The DataLogger Node can be used to record topics to a bag file.  This can work by either writing directly to the disk or by storing in RAM, and then a snapshot trigger is used to write to disk.

More detailed information can be found in the [Data Logger Node Documentation](../../../nodes/DataLoggerNode/doc/DataLoggerNode.md)
